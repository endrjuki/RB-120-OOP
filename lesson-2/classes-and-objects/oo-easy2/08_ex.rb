Fix The Program - Expander
What is wrong with the following code? What fix(es) would you make?

class Expander
  def initialize(string)
    @string = string
  end

  def to_s
    self.expand(3)
  end

  private

  def expand(n)
    @string * n
  end
end

expander = Expander.new('xyz')
puts expander
=end

class Expander
  def initialize(string)
    @string = string
  end

  def to_s
    expand(3)
  end

  private

  def expand(n)
    @string * n
  end
end

expander = Expander.new('xyz')
puts expander

# self.expand(3) is being called with an explicit caller(self) until Ruby 2.7, even when the caller is self.
# As of Ruby 2.7, it is now legal to call private methods with a literal self as the caller.
